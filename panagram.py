# Not implemented: For a given array of strings, where each string as a element can be a sentence, phrase or combination of letters, is a panagram if it has every letter in the alphabet without repetition. If for every panagram in the array, a 1 is assigned, and 0 for any other strings. Therefore in an array of [panagram, random, panagram], a string will be returned as '101'.
